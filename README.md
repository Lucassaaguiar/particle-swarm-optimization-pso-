# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Repository

This repository contains a basic implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The code has been evaluated using several benchmark functions, both with and without constraints. A quadratic penalty method was employed for handling constraints.

## Introduction

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based stochastic optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling. This repository provides a fundamental PSO algorithm implementation designed to solve optimization problems with and without constraints using a quadratic penalty method.

## Benchmark Functions

The PSO algorithm has been tested on various benchmark functions.

## Quadratic Penalty Method

The quadratic penalty method is used to handle constraints in the optimization process. This method adds a penalty term to the objective function for any violation of constraints, thereby guiding the swarm towards feasible solutions.
